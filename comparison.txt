Build Image (Ubuntu + Go): 648.67 MB
Run Image (Alpine + Binary): 10.33 MB

Difference: The build image is huge (over 600MB) because it contains the entire Ubuntu operating system, 
package managers, and the Go compiler tools required to build the source code. The run image is 
significantly smaller (only ~10MB) because it uses the lightweight Alpine Linux distribution and contains 
only the compiled binary executable, discarding all the heavy build tools and intermediate files.
